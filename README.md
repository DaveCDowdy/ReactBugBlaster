Bug Blaster: IT Ticketing System
This repository contains the completed code for Bug Blaster, an IT ticketing system built during a code-along from the React 18 Course 2025 by Jannick Leismann.

The application demonstrates the practical use of React reducers for managing application state. It serves as a comprehensive example of building a full-featured, state-managed application from the ground up, covering key concepts like component communication and data flow.

Key Features
Ticket Management: Create, view, edit, and delete IT support tickets.

State Management: Utilizes React's useReducer hook for efficient and predictable state updates.

Dynamic UI: Components are rendered conditionally based on the application's state, such as displaying a different view for a ticket that is being edited.
